## Work Experience

### Founder, Chief Investment Officer, Forward Horizon Investment LLC
*2023.10 - Now*

- Founded an investment advisor firm with the state of California, raised ~$1M capital from family and friends and individual investors.
- Led a group of college & high school students from AI-Camp to develop an LLM-based sourcing engine for investments, wrote the detailed PRD documents, and collaborated closely with students PM and developer for execution.

### Data Science Consultant, Bond Capital (Mary Meeker's Growth fund)
*2022.02 - 2024.9*

- Hired as a senior advisor to help Bond develop a data-driven investing road map
- Implemented end-to-end machine learning algorithms to help investors source growth-stage investment opportunities using xgBoost models with hundreds of features. Improved the recall from 23.2% with a naive rule based model to 37.5% with xgBoost and feature engineering
- Generated feature importance using SHAP values to gain insight into model behavior and feature importance. Developed backtesting infrastructure and pipeline using Spark/EMR to evaluate model performance and the impact of new features.
- Led the initiative to apply LLM to analyze large amounts of web & product review data using Snowflake's LLM capability. Developed a 2-stage prompting pipeline to improve output format consistency from 89.4% to 99.6%.

### Head of Data Science, Grow Therapy (Sequoia invested)
*2022.2 – 2022.11*

- Led the company-wide data science strategic roadmaps & data collection initiatives to enable Grow to build key data science capability across functions, including:
  - Initiated tracking and logging of provider availability over time, which turned out to be the most significant contribution in user conversion metrics after incorporating into company's provider-patient matching algorithms
  - Impression & cross-funnel conversion tracking to build conversion-driven ML models and optimize the full conversion funnel and user experience.
- Led the data science algorithm roadmap across Engineering, Product, and C-level to launch three versions of provider ranking algorithms using mix-effect & ML models to optimize conversion & retention. A/B testing results showed a +10% conversion increase after launch and a 7% increase in retention.
- Analyzed and created a reporting dashboard of medical claims history by payors across states to help the RCM (revenue cycle management) team optimize their resource allocation. This helped the RCM team to increase the efficiency of revenue cycle and dollar amount by 15%

### Director & Principal Data Scientist, Signalfire LLC
*2018.3 – 2022.1*

- Implemented a new xgBoost machine learning model to rank millions of startups for sourcing new deals using Python, Scala/Spark. Responsible for feature transformation, parameter tuning with cross-validation, and systematic end-to-end backtesting framework. The new xgBoost model improved the performance by 20% compared to the existing model (measured by recall).
  - Deployed a cutting-edge feature importance method named SHAP-value to measure feature importance and get insight into the models, specifically, what makes a start-up stand out from an algorithmic perspective.
- Delivered an end-to-end early-stage founder ranking model that significantly improved Signalfire's sourcing coverage of early seed start-ups (e.g., stealth mode), in charge of the whole product & pipeline delivery from ETL using Scala & Spark, to model deployment using Python, to presenting to investors.
- Integrated multiple data sources (over 100 Gigabytes) into Signalfire's data & ranking system and created new rankings based on these data sources for deal sourcing, particularly around Enterprise & B2B SaaS companies.

### Data Scientist, Stitch Fix
*2014.11 – 2018.2*

- Initiated and drove company-wide efforts to make merchandise by client segments, particularly by size and fit. Applied clustering algorithms and mix-effect regression model to recommend styles to different client segments. After delivering an end-to-end A/B test to evaluate the impact of merchandise by size segment, my recommendations are applied to larger-scale merchandise, affecting million-dollar merchandise decisions.
- Applied point of measurement data and spline regression to identify the optimal measurement for clients of different body shapes and fit preferences across sizes. The results were presented to Stitch Fix C-level, an IPO roadshow. A patent was filed and approved by USPTO

### Quantitative Analyst / Data Scientist, Google Play
*2013.11 - 2014.10*

- As the first data scientist at Google Play, I led the customer lifetime value (CLV) project. The model prototype I developed decently predicts the majority (>98%) of Play's paid user's lifetime value and active status on the individual level. I further collaborated with Play's PM and Engineering team to scale and deploy the model on production to Google Play globally.
- Led junior analysts to apply statistical models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to identify the main drivers of Play Music subscription, conversions, retention, and churn. Based on the results, we developed strategies to improve conversion rates and reduce churn rates.

### Analytic Lead, Sales Ops and Strategy, Google Inc
*2011.2 - 2014.10*

- Designed and conducted rigorous A/B tests by geo to help Google's large retail clients to evaluate the impact of online Adwords campaigns on their offline sales. Deliver end-to-end analysis from experiment design, data collection, data analysis, and presenting to external clients with Google's sales team
